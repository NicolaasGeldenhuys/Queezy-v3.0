<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project
<!-- header image of project -->
![image1][image1]

### Project Description

Squeezy is the ultimate food quiz! 
Think you’re the ultimate foodie? Prove it!<br>

Squeezy is an entertainment gamified application
built to test user’s knowledge of food across the globe. <br> Squeezy has multiple different categories upon which its questions are based. <br> These answers are updated on a highscore system as well as based on a profile system showing the score of each previous user.

### Built With

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
<!-- Make sure to add appropriate information about what prerequesite technologies the user would need and also the steps to install your project on their own mashines -->

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

* For this project my entire application was based off of Kotlin through Android Studio. I made use of Android’s Material UI components in regards of my application’s look and feel and designed everything on Figma. Furthermore I tested the user flow as well as design principles’ effectivity through Figma’s prototyping tools.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
The most important and most obvious learning with this module was programming an application for mobile and learning the functionality behind both the language as well as Android Studio as an IDE for apps! <br> I learned a lot from things ranging from device compatibility, to software compatibility as well as general cohesiveness between different pages as well as components. <br> I have become a lot more comfortable with the overall idea of development for Android and have had a lot of experience with planning accordingly throughout this term!pages as well as components.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
By far the biggest challenge for me this term was getting back into development after not doing any programming work in the last year. As an XD student this was very informative and exactley the background experience I wanted to achieve!
<br>
Secondly, was learning a new language based a lot on Java, at first I really struggled finding my feet but I did really start understanding Kotlin in the last week and got back into the groove of programming!
<br>
Time management was as always a very concerning stress factor but I managed to do a proficient job given the timeframe!

### Reviews & Testing
<!-- stipulate how you've conducted testing in the form of peer reviews, feedback and also functionality testing, like unit tests (if applicable) -->

#### Feedback from Reviews

`Peer Reviews` were conducted by my fellow students and lecturer. The following feedback I found useful:

* Make the question buttons bigger.
* Have consistency between elements.

#### Unit Tests

`Unit Tests` were conducted to establish working functionality. Here are all the tests that were ran:

* Good navigation, need to work more on productivity!
* Got a lot more done in terms of functionality!

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Better leaderboard system.
* Fixed overriden icons and add more questions/categories..
